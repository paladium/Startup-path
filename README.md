# Startup-path
I got myself caught in the cycle of making a new application and doing all the same steps over and over again, like opening a domain, setting up a git, coming soon page etc. So I decided to make a document to collect all the steps I usually go through in order to setup a new startup.

## How to use
You can clone the repository and check the items once you have completed them. You can customise the document to your particular needs. I tried to put everything into logical order.

## New startup check-list

[] Choose a name (choose a short, brandable name. If you get stuck with the name, use the following resources to generate one, along with the logo: https://namelix.com/, https://businessnamegenerator.com/)
[] Choose a logo for the company, you could design one yourself by finding the icon at https://www.flaticon.com/ or ordering one at https://www.fiverr.com/ (the prices are quite low, about 5$ for a decent logo)
[] Register a domain. I use https://namecheap.com for domain management
[] Setup a coming soon page. I try not to setup any server at this point, so the method that worked for me is the combination of Heroku and Netlify. Netlify offers awesome CDN and one-click deployment, Heroku offers free one-click deployment for backend. For the mailing list I use Airtable, because it offers the level of customisation I need and the API is pretty easy to use.
[] Setup a domain email. There are lots of services to setup a free email service for your domain. I personally use https://biz.mail.ru, because they offer unlimited number of emails, for example for future employees or bots.
[] Setup social media. You should setup your social media on a separate email, like contact@mystartup.com, it will help to unify all the emails into one stream.
